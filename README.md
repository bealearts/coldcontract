# coldcontract
ColdContract is a ColdSpring AOP Advice which allows Design by Contract assertions to be added to ColdFusion components and for those assertions to be executed during program execution. Assertions are added to components using meta data attributes.

Design by Contract assertions are a mechanism for defining the specification of software components, in such a way as to allow the implementation of the specification to be tested in-line with program execution. This provides a difference (and arguably quicker) method of implementing TDD, to Unit Testing.
